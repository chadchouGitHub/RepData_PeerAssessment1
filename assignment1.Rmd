This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data
Read data into R, and convert date col into Date format.
Remove missing data in "step" col.

```{r}
StepData <-  read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE, na.strings="NA")
StepData$date <- as.Date(StepData$date, format="%Y-%m-%d")
newStepData <- StepData[!is.na(StepData$step),]
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r}

```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r}

```

## Imputing missing values
```{r}

```


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
```{r}

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
